cng_test  

 	Executes a program that computes the effect of a third molecule on the interaction of
	free energy of two molecules placed equidistantly. It requires the following input:

		./exec cng [PQR file] [distance between molecles] [runname]
	The following files should be in the CWD: *pqr and charges_OPLS

  And it outputs the following:

	[runname]_dist.txt 
		This file has 900 lines, each line representing the interaction free energy 
		between two molecules. The first value in each line represents the system 
		of just two molecules, the next 30 values represents including a 3rd 
		molecule in the system at 30 different orientations.

 -------------------------

dif_test  

	Executes the computation of the potential at points on a grid in space from -75 to +75, 
	for a system oof 2, 4, 6, or 8 molecules placed equidistantly in a salty solution.
	 It requires the following input:

		./exec dif [PQR file] [2, 4, 6 or 8 molecules] [distance between molecules]
  The following files should be in the CWD: *pqr and charges_OPLS

  And it outputs the following:

	pqrname_[# part]P.mdp
			A PQR file of file of molecules in their positions created by dif run with
			original OPLS partial charges
	pqrname_[# part]P_sp.mdp
			Same as first PQR file, but with CG spheres included as well
	pqrname_[# part]P.gmpe
			A file of gridded potentials at 151 points for the X, Y and Z dimension.

 -------------------------

inf_test  

	Executes the creation of an infinite grid approximation. It requires the following input:

		./exec inf [PQR file] [# lattice layers] [stretch factor]
	  The following files should be in the CWD: *pqr and charges_OPLS

  And it outputs the following:
	
	pqrname_88.pdb 
		A PDB file of the input molecule with [# lat lay] layers in a grid

	*.out
		The program prints out the potential, the XYZ force and the XYZ torque
		for the eight molecules placed at the center of the infinite grid

 -------------------------

pol_test  

	Executes a routine the compares the force and torque of identical molecules places equidistantly
	in a salty environment, with and without mutual polarization effects. It requires the following input:

		./exec pol [PQR file] [2, 4, 6 or 8 molecules] [distance between molecules] [runname]
		The following files should be in the CWD: *pqr and charges_OPLS

  And it outputs the following:

	polar_[force/torque]_name_nmol_dist.txt
			The first line indicates the force or torque computed per molecule in the absence of 
			mutual polarization. The next line includes mutual polarization. These 2 lines repeat 1000 times.


 -------------------------

rad_test  

	Executes the self-polarizarion and potential calculation on a grid for a single CG molecule,
	positioned at (0,0,0).  Similar to dif option, but for only one molecule. It requires the 
	following input:

		 ./exec rad [PQR file] [scaling factor]
		The following files should be in the CWD: *pqr and charges_OPLS

  And it outputs the following:

	pqrname_[# part]P.mdp
			A PQR file of file of molecules in their positions created by dif run with
			original OPLS partial charges
	pqrname_[# part]P_sp.mdp
			Same as first PQR file, but with CG spheres included as well
	pqrname_[# part]P.gmpe
			A file of gridded potentials at 151 points for the X, Y and Z dimension.

 -------------------------

sim_test  

Executes the BD simulation part of the code.  It requires the following input:
	
		./exec sim [Salt conc] [outfile] [temp file #]
		The following files should be in the CWD: *pqr and charges_OPLS

	And it outputs the following:

	temp[temp file #].out 
		A temp file that outputs parameters while running each BD run

	[outfile]
		A File that contains the outcome of each BD run. the first 
		column is the status of the simulation at the end, the second
		is the trajectory number and the last column is the step number

 -------------------------

slv_test

	Computes the energies, forces and the torques on a system of multiple molecules,
	placed equidistantly in a salty solution.  It requires the following input:

		./exec slv [PQR file] [2, 4, 6 or 8 molecules] [distance between molecules]
		The following files should be in the CWD: *pqr and charges_OPLS

  And it outputs the following:		

	*.out 
		A list of each molecule in the system and the energy, force and torque acting on it
